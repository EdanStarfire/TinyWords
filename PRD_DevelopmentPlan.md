# TinyWords - MVP Development Plan

This document outlines the development plan for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the TinyWords game, based on the specifications in `PRD_GameUX.md`.

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Structure

*   **Task 1.1: New Project Creation**
    *   [x] Set up a new Android Studio project.
    *   [x] Configure `build.gradle` with necessary dependencies (e.g., Kotlin Coroutines, Jetpack Compose, ViewModel, LiveData/StateFlow, Jetpack DataStore).
*   **Task 1.2: Basic Asset & Initial TTS Management**
    *   [x] Create placeholder images for the three choices (`placeholder_1.png`, `placeholder_2.png`, `placeholder_3.png` added to `res/drawable`).
    *   [x] Implement a basic Text-To-Speech (TTS) helper class for word pronunciations (target words, "Correct!", "Try Again").
        *   [x] Handle TTS engine initialization and lifecycle.
    *   [x] Set up `strings.xml` for all user-facing text (initial target words, button labels, messages, TTS phrases like "Correct", "Try Again").
*   **Task 1.3: Data Structures for Words**
    *   [x] Define how the word list will be stored (e.g., hardcoded list, JSON in assets).
    *   [x] Define data class for a "Game Round" or "Word Challenge" (e.g., `WordChallenge(targetWord: String, correctImageWord: String, incorrectImageWord1: String, incorrectImageWord2: String, targetImageRes: Int, incorrect1ImageRes: Int, incorrect2ImageRes: Int)`).
*   **Task 1.4: Core Game Logic - State Management**
    *   [x] Create `GameViewModel` (extending `androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel`).
    *   [x] Inject or provide access to the TTS helper in `GameViewModel`.
    *   [x] Define state holders in `GameViewModel`:
        *   Current target word.
        *   Current image choices (associated words, drawable IDs).
        *   Correct/incorrect status.
        *   Score/streak.
        *   Hint status.
        *   Timer state.
        *   Settings values.
    *   [x] Implement basic functions in `GameViewModel` (logic for all core flows—hint, reset, choice, new game, settings update, and auto-advance—all present and functional):
        *   [x] `loadNewWordChallenge()` (pronounce new target word)
        *   [x] `processPlayerChoice(selectedWord: String)` (pronounce result/feedback)
        *   [x] `requestHint()`
        *   [x] 2025-07-25: Enhanced Tier 1 to spell word by TTS instead of pronouncing full word.
        *   [x] `resetGame()`
        *   [x] `startAutoAdvanceTimer()` / `cancelAutoAdvanceTimer()`
        *   [x] `updateSettings(newSettings: GameSettings)`
    *   [x] Update WordChallengeGenerator to disable randomness for testing purposes.
    *   [x] **2025-07-25: Bugfix – Auto-Advance interval is preserved on toggle:**
        * Fix: Toggling auto-advance OFF does not clear the stored delay value. Toggling ON restores the previous delay, always enforcing minimum value. This is managed in GameViewModel and GameSettingsPreferences, not in UI state. Tested live and via instrumented test.


## Phase 2: UI Implementation - Main Game Screen (Portrait First with Jetpack Compose)

*   **Task 2.1: Basic Layout (Portrait)**
    *   [x] Create main activity & Jetpack Compose content view.
    *   [x] Implement portrait layout: `TargetWordArea`, `ImageChoicesArea`, `GameBorder`, internal dividers.
*   **Task 2.2: Target Word Display & Pronunciation**
    *   [x] Composable for target word from `GameViewModel`.
    *   [x] Trigger TTS pronunciation of the target word via `GameViewModel` when it appears/changes.
    *   [x] Implement dynamic highlighting for Hint Tier 1, matching PRD logic (highlight the differing letter position among image choices for the current target word).
    *   [x] **2025-07-25: Bugfix – Shrink target word font (portrait):**
        * Target word font size reduced slightly in portrait mode to prevent bottom clipping; now displays cleanly without cutoff across devices."
*   **Task 2.3: Image Choices Display & Interaction**
    *   [x] Reusable Composable for a single image choice.
    *   [x] Display three images from `GameViewModel`.
    *   [x] Implement tap handling, linking to `GameViewModel.processPlayerChoice()`.
    *   [x] Grey out and disable any image choice immediately after an incorrect tap as per PRD feedback flow.
*   **Task 2.4: Feedback Implementation (Visual & TTS Auditory)**
    *   [x] Visual feedback: dynamic border for correct/incorrect, visual error persists for all wrong choices (animation pending).
    *   [x] Auditory feedback: TTS for "Correct!" / "Try Again" / selected word replay via `GameViewModel`.
    *   [x] After each incorrect selection, visually grey out (desaturate) only the chosen image and disable its tap, as per GameUX feedback.
    *   [x] Show words under images after correct or incorrect answers, with only the differing letter highlighted (green for correct, red for incorrect), following the feedback sequence in the PRD (animation or more detail pending).
*   **Task 2.5: Border UI Elements (Static Display & Feedback Logic)**
    *   [x] Composables for `ScoreStreakDisplay`, `RestartButton`, `HelpButton`, `OptionsButton`.
    *   [x] Position within `GameBorder`. Display initial values from `GameViewModel`.
    *   [x] Implement logic for "I Need Help" button: enabled at the start of each new word, disabled after using Tier 2, re-enabled for the next word, matching UX rules.
    *   [x] Ensure feedback animations (shake, star burst, border color) and UI placement exactly follow visual/interaction details in the GameUX PRD.

## Phase 3: UI Implementation - Border UI Functionality & Settings

*   (Tasks remain largely the same but assume TTS is used for any relevant auditory feedback from actions)
*   **Task 3.1: Score/Streak Logic**
    *   [x] Keep score and streak state correct and in sync after all player/game actions
    *   [x] Score persists through session (until reset)
    *   [x] Streak resets on incorrect, increments on correct
    *   [x] Visual feedback for score increase (popup '+N' display) overlays ScoreProgressBar in both orientations (Box with min size), and is no longer in GameBorder; streak remains via static counter; loss handled by main feedback. 
*   **Task 3.2: Restart Button Functionality**
    *   [x] Implement restart confirmation dialog ("Are you sure?") before reset; confirmation/reset flow is now exclusively in the Settings dialog footer, not in the border UI.
    *   [x] Reset all game state on restart (score, streak, progress, hints)
    *   [-] Optionally: add TTS confirmation prompt for reset (will not implement; not needed for MVP)
    *   [x] Border restart/reset options and dialog removed for clarity and responsive usability; all reset actions are via modal at end of Settings.
*   **Task 3.3: "I Need Help" Button Functionality**
    *   [x] Hint Tier 1 works (now spells word via TTS—e.g., "C A T" for CAT—and highlights letter in TargetWord, 2025-07-25)
    *   [x] Hint Tier 2 disables/greys out one distractor
    *   [x] Hint button enable/disable logic is correct after every game event
*   **Task 3.4: "Next Word" Button**
    *   [x] Button appears after correct answer if auto-advance is off or timer is running
    *   [x] Immediate manual advance works and resets display state cleanly
    *   [x] Hide button once next word has loaded
*   **Task 3.5: Auto-Advance Timer**
    *   [x] Configurable timer visible/counts down after correct answer
    *   [x] (Moved to 3.6) Timer can be toggled in settings
    *   [x] Correct behavior if interrupted (background, settings change)
*   **Task 3.6: Options/Settings Screen/Dialog**
    *   [x] Implement modal or screen for user to modify:
        *   [x] Timer on/off and duration
        *   [x] Always Show Words Under Images
        *   [x] TTS rate/speed (0.25x - 2.0x range with live display)
        *   [x] Pronounce target word at start of each challenge (default: OFF)
        *   [ ] Other future toggles
*   **Task 3.7: Settings Persistence (Jetpack DataStore)**
    *   [x] Save user settings persistently
    *   [x] Reload settings on app launch
    *   [-] All preference toggles are idempotent and update UI/game immediately (deferred; see 5.3 for enhancement)

## Phase 4: Word Progression & Responsive Layout

*   **Task 4.1: Word List & Progression Logic**
    *   [x] Ensure each correct answer leads to a new (unique and valid) word challenge, ideally a one-letter change from the last correct word (see GameUX §4 §9, PRD §5).
    *   [x] Randomize/shuffle the display order of all image/word choices each round so the correct answer is never in a fixed position.
    *   [x] If word pool is exhausted or can't generate distinct challenge, handle gracefully and let user restart.
    *   [x] Ensure no challenge presents the same word for multiple choices, even if duplicates exist in word list. (Handled by generator logic & duplicate-detection test) 
*   **Task 4.2: Landscape Layout Implementation**
    *   [x] Implement main game and border UI in landscape orientation, verifying that all key elements are faithfully arranged and scale/position as required. (Manual test confirmed 2025-07-22)
    *   [x] Ensure all border buttons, feedback, and indicators function correctly in both orientations (see GameUX §3.1, layout specifics). (Manual test confirmed 2025-07-22)
*   **Task 4.3: Image Assets** ([x] All main word images are now loaded. Placeholders fully replaced for MVP target word set. Further art polish is post-MVP.)
    *   [x] All MVP images and drawables are loaded; landscape/portrait word-under-image UI, hit area, and overlap issues fixed July 2025. Further art polish and asset documentation are post-MVP.
*   **Task 4.4: High Score Support and Persistence**
    *   [x] Track and persist high scores for both Streak and Score.
    *   [x] High scores persist across sessions (saved until reset).
    *   [x] High scores are reset to zero when the user uses the reset feature.
    *   [x] When a player surpasses the previous high score/streak, update and display as new high.
    *   [x] High score/streak is remembered until reset or mistake. Displayed alongside score/streak in UI for now.

*   **Task 4.5: High Score Progress Bar + Display**
    *   [x] Build and show a progress bar reflecting current score progress toward the high score. '+N' popup is overlaid above the progress bar and respects minimum visual area; fully responsive.
    *     [x] The progress bar should be near the full width of the screen on portrait mode horizontally.
    *     [x] Portrait mode bars should fill left-to-right.
    *     [x] For landscape mode, the progress bar should be a vertical bar in the GameBorder on the left side of the screen.
    *     [x] Landscape mode bars should fill bottom-to-top.
    *   [x] Rules of this visual indicator:
    *     [x] In the case of a high score of 0 (reset), the progress can go from 0 (min) to 1 (max)
    *     [x] Otherwise, if the high score is > the current score, the progress bar should go from 0 (min) to the High Score (max).
    *       [x] In this case, the progress fill should be the current score value
    *     [x] If the current score is > the high score, the progress bar should go from 0 (min) to current score (max)
    *       [x] In this case, the progress bar should remain filled completely.
    *     [x] At the far left of the progress bar should be a small area for a current score. It should support numbers up to 99,999.
    *   [x] The rainbow border uses RainbowFull, visible around all progress bars and confirmation dialogs. RainbowMain is removed. All borders/generic gradients now reference RainbowFull for consistency. (2025-07-27)
    *   **NOTE (2025-08-01): Score-based progress bar deprecated in favor of streak-based system (Task 4.6). The scoring logic resets score to 0 on any incorrect answer, making score progress representation less meaningful than streak progress. Score-based progress bar can be restored if scoring logic changes in future iterations.**

*   **Task 4.6: Streak-Based Progress Bar System**
    *   [x] **2025-08-01: Complete overhaul of progress bar to represent streaks instead of scores:**
        *   [x] Renamed `ScoreProgressBar` → `StreakProgressBar` with streak-focused parameters
        *   [x] Progress calculation now uses `currentStreak / highStreak` instead of `score / highScore`
        *   [x] Display text shows current streak number instead of score value
        *   [x] Updated all call sites in both landscape and portrait orientations
        *   [x] **Delta feedback system redesigned for streak tracking:**
            *   [x] Replaced `scoreDelta` with `streakDelta` in ViewModel and UI
            *   [x] Correct answers show `+1` in green (always +1 for streak increment)
            *   [x] Incorrect answers show `-N` in red (where N is the lost streak count)
            *   [x] Color-coded feedback: SuccessGreen for gains, FailRed for losses
            *   [x] Updated visibility logic to show both positive and negative deltas
        *   [x] **Rationale**: The scoring system essentially tracked streaks anyway since score resets to 0 on any incorrect answer, making streak-based progress representation much more intuitive and meaningful for users.

*   (Tasks remain largely the same)
*   **Task 4.7: Choice Image Shake Animation**
    *   [x] Enable shake animation for all clicked image choices (both right and wrong picks). (Checkpoint: Now triggers shake on every selection, #2025-07-25)
    *   [x] Keep existing color feedback for correct/wrong but add universal shake effect on press.

*   **Task 4.8: Target Word Tap-to-Spell (Replaces Button)**
    *   [x] Tapping the target word now triggers TTS to spell out the word letter-by-letter (e.g., C A T for CAT), using TtsHelper/GameViewModel.
    *   [x] No additional button is implemented; spell-out occurs via direct word tap for improved child-friendly usability.
    *   [x] This replaces the intended 'speaker icon' button and matches current product UX direction.

*   **Task 4.9: Finalize Game Settings - Reskin Restart Button**
    *   [x] Settings modal fully reskinned (2025-07-27): uses centralized color/theme/rainbow constants, modal and section backgrounds, rainbow borders, and all tab underlines/headers now reflect AccentPink, AccentBlue, AccentPurple.
    *   [x] Tab bar is full-width, all backgrounds/underlines use constants, and all borders use RainbowFull. Confirm/cancel UI dialog uses centralized modal constants.
    *   [x] Game settings properly padded/scoped; Reset confirmation dialog and all modal overlays now match full finalized design and palette.
    *   [x] All previously unfinished modal, underline, and rainbow skinning tasks are complete.

*   **Task 4.10: Settings Modal Tabs**
    *   [x] Four settings modal tabs ('Game', 'Music', 'Speech', 'About') reorganized with proper content distribution:
        *   [x] Game tab: Auto-advance timer, word display options, reset scores functionality
        *   [x] Music tab: Background music volume and track selection
        *   [x] Speech tab: TTS speed control, letter spelling delay, TTS enable/disable 
        *   [x] About tab: App summary, AI disclosure, and dynamic version display (v1.0.1)
    *   [x] Tab colors updated: Pink (Game), Blue (Music), Green (Speech), Purple (About)
    *   [x] Fixed layout issues preventing unwanted scrolling in settings tabs
*   **Task 4.11: Background Music Selection**
    *   [x] Implement background music selection and playbook for MP3s. Allow user to choose tracks in Sound tab of settings.
    *   [x] Build out sound settings: master volume, music volume, TTS enable/disable, and music selection options.
    *   [x] Change default background music track to 'chill.mp3'.
    *   [x] Add letter spelling delay slider to Sound settings tab (2025-07-31): Users can now adjust the delay between letters when words are spelled out via TTS, ranging from 500ms to 2000ms in 250ms increments.
    *   [x] **2025-08-01: Enhanced background music selection UI with discrete slider:**
        *   [x] **Replaced DropdownMenu with Slider**: Converted dropdown selection to discrete slider for consistent design pattern
        *   [x] **Real-time track switching**: Music changes immediately as user drags slider (no dropdown interactions needed)
        *   [x] **Consistent theming**: Uses `AccentBlue` colors to match Music tab aesthetic
        *   [x] **Typography consistency**: Current track name displayed in 12sp font below title (matching TTS Speed pattern)
        *   [x] **Maintains all 8 tracks**: 8-bit, Bedtime, Bounce, Chill, Electric, Epic, Island, Mystery options preserved
        *   [x] **Index-based selection**: Discrete slider with 6 steps between 8 track options for precise control
        *   [x] **Improved mobile UX**: Slider interactions more touch-friendly than dropdown menus
*   **Task 4.12: App Icon Migration**
    *   [x] Migrated app icon to a new custom asset, placed app_icon.png in all mipmap-* folders for proper device support and updated manifest reference. Ensured all new icon files are included in git and handled mipmap-anydpi guidance.

*   **Task 4.13: Version Management System**
    *   [x] Implemented automated version display system:
        *   [x] Updated app version to v1.0.1 (versionCode 2) in build.gradle.kts
        *   [x] Added dynamic version display in About tab that reads from app package info
        *   [x] Version automatically updates in UI when build version is changed
        *   [x] Positioned version display in bottom-right corner of About settings tab

*   **Task 4.14: Settings Modal Close Button**
    *   [x] **2025-08-01: Enhanced settings modal with dedicated close button:**
        *   [x] **CloseButton Composable**: Custom-designed close button component
            *   [x] Size: 30dp × 30dp rounded square (75% size for subtle appearance)
            *   [x] Styling: Pink background (`ConfirmPink`) with rainbow border (`RainbowFull`)
            *   [x] Icon: Custom Canvas-drawn X with `AccentPink` color (matches game tab underline)
            *   [x] Proportions: 15dp × 15dp X icon with 2.5dp stroke width for visual balance
        *   [x] **Modal Integration**: Added close button to `ThemedSettingsModal`
            *   [x] Positioning: Top-right corner with optimized overlap (3/4 inside, 1/4 outside modal border)
            *   [x] Offset: `(x = 12.dp, y = -12.dp)` for proper text clearance and visual balance
            *   [x] Functionality: Triggers `onDismiss()` callback for consistent modal dismissal
        *   [x] **Technical Implementation**:
            *   [x] Added `androidx.compose.foundation.layout.offset` import
            *   [x] Custom Canvas drawing with hardcoded dimensions for compilation stability
            *   [x] Color consistency using established theme palette (`AccentPink`, `ConfirmPink`, `RainbowFull`)
        *   [x] **UX Enhancement**: Provides intuitive close option beyond clicking outside modal area

*   **Task 4.15: Exit Game Button with Confirmation**
    *   [x] **2025-08-01: Added Exit Game functionality to settings modal:**
        *   [x] **Exit Game Button**: Added dedicated exit button in Game tab of settings modal
            *   [x] Styling: Uses `ModalLightBg` background with rainbow border for visual distinction from Reset Scores
            *   [x] Functionality: Cleanly exits application using `android.os.Process.killProcess(android.os.Process.myPid())`
            *   [x] Safety: Dismisses settings modal before exit to prevent UI state issues
        *   [x] **Responsive Layout Design**:
            *   [x] **Portrait Mode**: Exit Game button positioned below Reset Scores button vertically
            *   [x] **Landscape Mode**: Exit Game and Reset Scores share same horizontal row for space efficiency
            *   [x] Consistent 16dp spacing between buttons in landscape, 16dp top padding for Exit Game in portrait
        *   [x] **Confirmation Dialog System**:
            *   [x] Added `showExitConfirm` state management alongside existing `showResetConfirm`
            *   [x] Exit confirmation displays "Are you sure you want to exit the game?" message
            *   [x] Yes/No buttons with consistent styling (ModalLightBg for Yes, ConfirmPink for No)
            *   [x] **Mutual Exclusion**: Both buttons hide when either confirmation dialog is active (prevents confusion)
        *   [x] **State Management Enhancement**:
            *   [x] Refactored settings modal button logic with proper if/else if/else structure
            *   [x] Consistent behavior across portrait and landscape orientations
            *   [x] Maintains existing Reset Scores functionality while adding Exit Game capability

*   **Task 4.16: Comprehensive Settings Modal Slider Theming System**
    *   [x] **2025-08-01: Complete overhaul of slider appearance and implementation across all settings tabs:**
        *   [x] **Theme-Matched Color System**: Each tab's sliders now match their respective background themes
            *   [x] **Game Tab (Pink)**: `MediumPink` active track, `AccentPink` thumb, `PastelPink` tick marks
            *   [x] **Music Tab (Blue)**: `MediumBlue` active track, `AccentBlue` thumb, `PastelBlue` tick marks  
            *   [x] **Speech Tab (Green)**: `MediumGreen` active track, `SuccessGreen` thumb, `PastelGreen` tick marks
            *   [x] All tabs use `Color.LightGray` for inactive track color for consistent contrast
        *   [x] **New Color Palette Additions**:
            *   [x] Added `MediumBlue` (`0xFF83C4FE`) - Music tab medium blue for active tracks
            *   [x] Added `MediumGreen` (`0xFF66BB6A`) - Speech tab medium green for active tracks
            *   [x] Added `PastelGreen` (`0xFFA5D6A7`) - Speech tab light green for tick marks
            *   [x] Added `MediumPink` (`0xFFFFB3DA`) - Game tab medium pink for active tracks
        *   [x] **Tick Mark System for Discrete Sliders**:
            *   [x] **Auto-Advance Timer**: 6 discrete values (Off, 3s, 5s, 8s, 15s, 30s) with visible pink tick marks
            *   [x] **Background Track Selection**: 8 music tracks with visible blue tick marks for precise selection
            *   [x] **TTS Speed**: 8 discrete speeds (0.25x to 2.0x) with visible green tick marks
            *   [x] **Letter Spelling Delay**: 7 discrete delays (500ms to 2000ms) with visible green tick marks
            *   [x] **Background Music Volume**: Continuous slider without tick marks (intentional)
        *   [x] **Clean Code Architecture**:
            *   [x] **Single-source-of-truth**: Thumb colors specified only in main `Slider.colors` parameter for visibility
            *   [x] **Track override pattern**: Track/tick colors specified only in `SliderDefaults.Track` override
            *   [x] **Eliminated redundancy**: Removed ~50+ lines of duplicate color specifications
            *   [x] **Zero thumb gap**: Consistent `thumbTrackGapSize = 0.dp` across all sliders
        *   [x] **Fixed Visibility Issues**: Resolved thumb color display problems through proper parameter placement
        *   [x] **Consistent Implementation**: All 5 sliders follow identical clean pattern for maintainability

*   **Task 4.17: Settings UI Consistency & Spacing Improvements**  
    *   [x] **2025-08-01: Inline value display standardization across all settings:**
        *   [x] **TTS Speed**: Changed from separate title/value to inline "TTS Speed (1.0x)" format
        *   [x] **Letter Spelling Delay**: Updated to inline "Letter Spelling Delay (1500ms)" format  
        *   [x] **Background Music Volume**: Added inline "Background Music Volume (75%)" format
        *   [x] **Auto-Advance Timer**: Updated to use smaller font (12.sp) for value text in parentheses
        *   [x] All value displays use consistent 12.sp font size with proper Row alignment
    *   [x] **Settings reorganization and checkbox consistency:**
        *   [x] **Moved "Spell Target Word"** from Game tab to Speech tab for better thematic grouping
        *   [x] **Renamed** to "Spell Word at Start" for clearer functionality description
        *   [x] **Updated checkbox styling** to SuccessGreen color scheme matching Speech tab theme
        *   [x] **Standardized spacing** across all checkboxes using `padding(top = 16.dp, bottom = 2.dp)`
    *   [x] **About tab text spacing fix:**
        *   [x] Fixed double-spaced line wrapping by adding explicit `lineHeight = 12.sp`
        *   [x] Eliminated awkward text spacing in portrait mode with controlled line height ratio (1.2)

*   **Task 4.18: Repository Maintenance & Build Artifact Management**
    *   [x] **2025-08-01: Enhanced .gitignore protection for Android development:**
        *   [x] **Android build artifacts**: Added `app/release/`, `app/debug/`, `*/build/` exclusions
        *   [x] **Security files**: Added `*.jks`, `*.keystore`, `keystore.properties` exclusions  
        *   [x] **Development files**: Added `*.hprof`, `.claude/settings.local.json` exclusions
        *   [x] **Repository cleanup**: Removed tracked build artifacts and sensitive files from version control
            *   [x] Removed `.claude/settings.local.json` (local development settings)
            *   [x] Removed `app/release/TinyWords_v1.0.0.aab` and `.apk` (release builds)
            *   [x] Removed `app/release/baselineProfiles/` and `output-metadata.json` (build metadata)
        *   [x] **Best practices**: Prevents accidental commits of large files, build artifacts, and credentials

## Phase 5: Refinement & Testing

*   **Task 5.1: TTS Refinements & Optional Sound Effects**
    *   [x] Test TTS pronunciation clarity and timing across different scenarios.
    *   [x] Adjust TTS parameters (pitch, rate) if necessary for better experience.
    *     [x] Slow down the spelling speed - it's pretty fast right now. (2025-07-28): Now each letter is spoken by TTS with a ~750ms pause between, implemented via coroutine per-letter in GameViewModel.)
    *     [x] Make letter spelling delay user-configurable (2025-07-31): Added slider in Audio settings tab allowing users to adjust delay between letters from 500ms to 2000ms in 250ms increments. Default remains 750ms.
    *     [x] Add TTS speed control (2025-08-01): Implemented configurable TTS speech rate from 0.25x to 2.0x speed with live display in Speech settings tab. All TTS calls now respect user's preferred speech rate.
    *   [ ] (Post-MVP or iterative) Consider adding subtle, non-verbal sound effects for UI interactions (button clicks, animations) if desired, to complement TTS.
*   **Task 5.2: Thorough Testing** (Includes testing TTS functionality thoroughly)
*   **Task 5.3: UI Polish & Animations**
    *   [x] Improve default font for child readability and letterform distinction (e.g. Comic Neue Bold—clearer I/l differentiation)
    *   [x] Settings toggles update UI/game immediately as toggled (idempotent and fully live; all toggles/sliders now update instantly, dialog no longer has OK/Cancel).
    *   [x] All main button and background drawables loaded for MVP; further icon/layout polish post-MVP.
    *   [ ] Score progress bar (% to high score + % to high streak and then marking them as they pass)
    *   [x] Re-lay out image choice to 2 horizontal/1 horizontal and finalize all borders, spacing, and cartoon/correctness highlight for MVP. Dashed/stateful borders, margin/padding fixes, and all feedback placement are complete. (2025-07-24)
    *   [x] Reskin the entire app
    *   [x] Target word sizing landscape/portrait, no-gap logic, and image-choice layout margins finalized for MVP (July 2025).
    *   [x] Reskin options modal + the reset modal. Settings now use:
        * Discrete slider for Auto-Advance (Off/3/5/8/15/30s), pink color, compact
        * Checkboxes now pink, compact, left of text
        * Setting dialog remains open on rotation (rememberSaveable)
        * All layout/padding minimized for mobile UX
    *   [x] Add pulsing animation to "Next Word" button, and remove all text-based score/streak counters from GameBorder for a cleaner, visual-only layout.
*   **Task 5.4: Code Cleanup & Documentation**

## Corrections, Known Issues, and Pending Feature Tasks (pre-polish)

*   [x] TTS pronounces POP as an acronym instead of 'pop': Fixed by lowercasing only words that are fully uppercase (acronyms) and more than one letter before sending them to TTS, ensuring target/image words are pronounced correctly and general phrases/messages retain their intended casing.
*   [x] Prevent the words from being pronounced when the device is rotated.
*   [x] Ensure the word is pronounced on the first display of the app (if setting enabled to do so).
*   [x] Stop the game from auto-progressing when the app is backgrounded.
*   [ ] Explore using the phonetic alphabet for sound matching (PRD section 7 & undecided/logic).
*   [ ] Explore indices instead of letters for sound matching (PRD section 7 & undecided/logic).
*   [ ] Explore recorded words instead of text-to-speech.
*   [x] Displaying score and streak prominently per GameUX.
*   [x] Add a "Next Word" button to bypass the auto-advance timer after a correct answer.
*   [ ] Review all PRD_GameUX details and complete any missing subtlety, especially:
    *   Visual feedback: star animation, shake effect, feedback sound for right/wrong.
    *   "Restart" should require a confirmation popup.
    *   Option for "Always Show Words Under Images" (toggle in Options).
    *   Options/settings dialog responsive placement. (Dialog now uses vertical scroll with restart modal at footer; all settings and actions always accessible on all screen sizes/orientations.)
    *   Support for landscape layout and border UI in all modes.
*   [ ] (General) Sweep for any additional polish or small gaps left in UI/logic per PRD/UX checklist.
